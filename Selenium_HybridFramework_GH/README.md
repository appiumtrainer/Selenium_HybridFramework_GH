Selenium Hybrid Framework: 
=================
It is a combination of Keyword & Data Driven Framework. All test cases, test steps & Test data are stored in excel sheet. 

Here is the Framework Folder Structure: 
----------------------------------------  
1: lib : You can store all your .jar files here.  
2: repository : This folder has a file called “OR (object Repository). This is a plain file and it has all locator values for each object.  
3: Src : This is important folder which has two packages. TestCases & Utils.   
4: test execution : We just created a folder to store our all “test case excel applications”  
5: TestNG: Contains TestNG's testing.jar file.  
6: Referenced libraries : It contains all library files which we configured with our Java Project.  
7: build : Eclipse saves all .class files in this folder.  
8: screenshots : It contains all screenshots generated by test cases.  
9: test-outputs : It contains all TestNG Reports, which are generated by TestNG.  
10: XSLT_Reports : It is report generated by ANT and we provided this location in build.xml to store it here.  
11: build.xml : This is a ANT build file.  
12: All .xml (TestNG Suite files: These are TestNG Suite files.

Framework contains two packages. Test case package & utility package.
- Testcase package contains all test cases files. (For ex: GoogleTest.java)
- Utility package contains all utility files (explained in below sections). 

**Lets look what “GoogleTest” case does:**
1: Creates a WebDriver and launches Firefox browser
2: navigates to www.google.com 
3: In google home page, In Search Textfield box, pass keyword “Selenium”
4: Click on Search button.
Note: I added only one test case and I need to add many more to cover various selenium concepts.

**Utility package:** It has below files.  
- DataProviderAnnotation.java.   
- Keywords_Run.java  
- TestData_Utilities.java  
- Get_Xls.java

Utility Files:  
**1: DataProviderAnnotation.java:**   
This class has @DataProvider annotation,  this return multidimensional object. We use this annotation to retrieve “Test Data” in “keyValue parameter”.   
1: @DataProvider Annotation required two parameters. One is "TestCase"File Path & TestCaseName. For these two tasks, we create an Object & a constructor.    
2: Creating an object for Xls_Reader class constructor. Which means, if you look at Xls_Reader.java constructor's code, it required a complete FilePath. Here we are creating an object by passing complete filepath.  
3: Creating a constructor. This constructor will be used by "TestCase" classes. Basically, TestCase class's constructor forward testcasename through constructor.
 
**2: Keywords_Run.java:**
1: This class contains a method which is used to performs/executes all Keywrods methods. 
For ex: If user writes, openBrowser Keyword in "testcase excel sheet", the associated openBrowser() method will be executed here.
2: executeKeywords() Method: This calls, many small methods like openbrowser(), navigate(), clickByXpath() & inputbyid(). 


**3: TestData_Utilities.java:** This file have two methods.  
1: isExecutableFromTestCasesSheet : Verifies in Test Cases Sheet: It verifies, if Runmode set to "Y"  
2: returnTestData : Retrive Test Data in "Key Value" parameter from TestData Sheet for a given TestCase  

**4: Get_Xls.java:** This file has many methods to perform actions on Excel application.

**Let see the “Test case execution” here:**   
1: For given “Test case”, first, we need to retrieve  test steps & test data from Excel sheet.  
2: Test Steps needs test data. Hence first, we need to retrieve “Test data”.  
3: Later, we need to pass test data inside test steps.   
4: “DataProviderAnnotation.java” class contains @DataProvider annotation, which returns “Test data” in multidimensional array (Object).   
5: Method “” executes for each Keyword, Object & TestData. In this method, we pass above retrierved TestData. This method executes each Test step and returns results :)

Now, lets see “**How to add a new Test case to framework**”:  
1: Addnew Test case name, and with its  “Test steps” & with its “Test data”  
2: In “Testing.TestCases package”,  Create a small .java class for this Test case (for ex: GoogleTest.java)  
3: If you add new Keywords in “TestSteps” sheet, then you need to add new keyword methods() in Keywords_Run.java & then update method “executeKeywords()”.
